## 🎨 The Melting Ice Cream Timer

Our signature feature! Here's how it works:

### Visual States
1. **🍦 Fresh**: Perfect scoops, ready to learn
2. **🍦 Warming**: Slight melting, keep going
3. **🍧 Soft**: Half melted, getting close
4. **💧 Dripping**: Warning state, almost break time
5. **💧💧 Melted**: Time for a break!

### Technical Implementation
- SVG-based animation for crisp visuals
- CSS transitions for smooth melting effect
- React hooks for timer management
- Responsive design for all devices

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Development server
- `npm run build`: Production build
- `npm test`: Run tests
- `npm run eject`: Eject from Create React App

### Adding New Algorithms

1. **Update algorithm data** in `src/utils/algorithms.js`
2. **Add question sets** in `src/services/aiService.js`
3. **Test the Socratic flow** with various user responses

### Customizing the Ice Cream Timer

Edit `src/components/MeltingIceCream.jsx`:
- Adjust `duration` prop for different session lengths
- Modify SVG paths for different ice cream designs
- Change melt stages and animations

## 🚀 Deployment

### Quick Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder** to your preferred hosting service

### Environment Variables for Production

- `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`: For real AI integration
- `REACT_APP_ENV`: Environment flag

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

### Why Socratic Method?
- **Active Learning**: Students construct knowledge vs. passive consumption
- **Deep Understanding**: Questions reveal underlying mental models
- **Critical Thinking**: Develops reasoning and problem-solving skills
- **Metacognition**: Students become aware of their thinking process

### Why the Ice Cream Timer?
- **Prevents Burnout**: Forces healthy learning breaks
- **Removes Guilt**: External timer vs. self-imposed stopping
- **Memorable**: Creates emotional connection to learning
- **Sustainable**: Promotes long-term learning habits
