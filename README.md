# Socratic CS Learning Platform

An adaptive learning app that uses AI-generated Socratic questioning to guide users through computer science concepts, never giving direct answers but helping users construct understanding through discovery.

## üéØ Core Features

- **Preference-Based Learning Paths**: Choose between Conceptual, Applied, or Comprehensive tracks
- **Socratic Questioning Engine**: AI guides you with questions based on your responses
- **"Return to Basics" System**: Automatically guides users back to fundamentals when needed
- **Ice Cream Button üç¶**: Signal when you've reached thinking capacity for a helpful summary
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and session analytics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone or create a new React project:
```bash
npx create-react-app socratic-cs-learning
cd socratic-cs-learning
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install lucide-react
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss @tailwindcss/typography
```

3. Initialize Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

4. Replace the generated files with the provided code files:
   - Copy `App.js` content to `src/App.js`
   - Copy `index.js` content to `src/index.js`
   - Copy `index.css` content to `src/index.css`
   - Copy `tailwind.config.js` to project root
   - Copy `package.json` content (merge dependencies)

5. Create additional utility files:
   - Create `src/questionTrees.js` with the provided content
   - Create `src/socraticUtils.js` with the provided content

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## üìñ How It Works

### Learning Flow
1. **Choose Your Path**: Select Conceptual, Applied, or Comprehensive track
2. **Engage with Questions**: Answer in your own words (no copy-pasting!)
3. **Build Understanding**: Discover concepts through guided questioning
4. **Take Breaks**: Use the üç¶ button when you need to process information
5. **Track Progress**: Watch your understanding grow with visual progress indicators

### Question Tree System
The app uses a sophisticated question tree structure that:
- Matches user responses with expected patterns
- Provides fallback questions for unexpected answers
- Adapts difficulty based on user performance
- Implements Bloom's taxonomy for progressive learning

### Example User Journey (Euclidean Algorithm)
```
App: "What problem do you think the Euclidean algorithm solves?"
User: "Finding common factors?"
App: "Close! What's the biggest common factor of 12 and 8?"
User: "4"
App: "Perfect! So if we wanted the GREATEST common divisor, how would you find it?"
...continues with guided discovery...
```

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React**: Component-based UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Custom Hooks**: For state management and learning analytics

### Key Components
- `SocraticCSApp`: Main application component
- `questionTrees.js`: Question tree data structures
- `socraticUtils.js`: Learning logic and response analysis

### Question Tree Structure
```javascript
{
  node_id: {
    question: "What is...",
    responses: {
      "expected_answer": "next_node_id"
    },
    fallback: "fallback_node_id"
  }
}
```

### Response Matching Algorithm
1. **Direct Matching**: Exact keyword matches
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Semantic variations and synonyms
3. **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling of unexpected responses
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment of matches

## üìö Adding New Topics

To add a new computer science topic:

1. **Create Question Tree**: Define the learning path in `questionTrees.js`
```javascript
export const newTopic = {
  start: {
    question: "Your opening question...",
    responses: { /* expected responses */ },
    fallback: "fallback_node"
  },
  // ... more nodes
};
```

2. **Register Topic**: Add to `availableTopics` in `questionTrees.js`
```javascript
"new-topic": {
  name: "New Topic",
  description: "Learn about...",
  difficulty: "beginner",
  questionTree: newTopic,
  estimatedTime: "20-25 minutes"
}
```

3. **Update App**: Modify the main component to include topic selection

## üé® Customization

### Styling
- Modify `tailwind.config.js` for theme customization
- Update `src/index.css` for custom component styles
- Colors, fonts, and animations are all configurable

### Learning Paths
- Add new paths in `questionTrees.js`
- Customize path behavior in `socraticUtils.js`
- Each path can have different questioning styles and emphasis

### Question Styles
The app supports four questioning approaches:
- **Direct Explanation**: Straightforward questions
- **Scenario-Based**: Context-driven problems
- **Puzzle & Brain Teaser**: Engaging challenges
- **Analogy & Metaphor**: Conceptual comparisons

## üìä Analytics & Progress Tracking

### Metrics Tracked
- Questions answered correctly/incorrectly
- Time spent per topic
- Learning path preferences
- Break patterns (ice cream button usage)
- Concept mastery progression

### Progress Visualization
- Linear progress bars
- Concept mastery indicators
- Session summaries
- Achievement celebrations
